# Application: To-do lists
A barebones codebase to design a simple application for tracking, storing, and managing to-do lists

## Installing Node.js
Follow the instructions here: https://www.codementor.io/mercurial/how-to-install-node-js-on-macos-sierra-mphz41ekk

Install dependencies:
---

#### From the root of the directory
`npm install`


Run the webpage on localhost:
---

#### From the root of the directory
`npm start`

## Instructions: 

The purpose of this project is to create a simple app to manage a list of to-do tasks. The app should have the following functionality. 

#### Functionality
- Allow the user to view, add, edit, or delete to-do tasks. The list of a user's to-do tasks can be shown as table. 
- Allow the user to edit the following details for each to-do task:
  - Name: The name of the task
  - Due Date: The date on which the task is due
  - Type: The type of ask i.e homework, project, job.
  - Is Finished: Whether the task has been completed or not. 
  - Notes: Any additional notes a user wants to add to the task.
- Allow the user to view, filter and sort the list of to-do tasks:
  - Allow the user to sort the tasks by due date, name, or type.
  - Allow the user to filter tasks based on whether they have been completed or not. 
  
#### Implementation Expectations
1. A web page that shows the to-do list items (as a table likely).  
  - I would recommend using a react app, but you can also use vanilla html, JS etc. 
  - This repository inlcudes a basic react app template that you can use in your project. 

2. An API Service that the web page talks with. This can be a python flask app (but feel free to use other languages or frameworks you're more familiar with). It can have the following endpoints:
    - POST /create: to create a new to-do item
    - PATCH /update: to updated an existing to-do item - this can be updated to any field, deleting the item, or marking it as finished

3. A persistent storage layer. All to-do tasks should be persisted, so I can start and stop the API service or the web app and still get the same data. 
  - I would recommend a simple local SQLite database. 

#### Tips:
- Think about using a react table component to display the to-do tasks. 
- Use RESTful practices when designing the API layer.
- Feel free to ask any questions you may have. 

## Deliverables:
- A working webpage where I can add, view, edit, or delete to-do tasks. 
- I should be able to sort or filter the tasks.
- Well-commented code.
- While it is not necessary to deploy the web app, it is encouraged. You can also send me a zip file of the fully functional project. 

## Good Luck!
